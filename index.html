          <h3>House Prices vs Disposable Income</h3>
          <p>Housing and home ownership, especially with regards to younger people, have caused many a heated debate in recent years. *More text*. In his latest book James O'Brien (2018)<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> argues that one of the greatest challenges young people face on their way to home ownership is the widening gap between house prices and income - evidence suggests that he and many others<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> who have voiced similar concerns have got a point. Let's have a look.</p>
          <p>Below you can see a chart that explores the relationship between the average house price (<em>Source: <a href="https://www.nationwide.co.uk/about/house-price-index/download-data#xtab:uk-series">Nationwide Building Society</a></em>) and average real disposable income per capita (<em>Source: <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/crxw/ukea">Office for National Statistics</a></em>), in the United Kingdom, from 1955 to 2017.</p>

          <p>Since the mid-1970s, house prices have generally grown much faster than real disposable income per capita, making it ever more difficult for individuals to buy homes. Millennials' spending habits have been subjected to much scrutiny<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>,<a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> over the last couple of years but I would like to think that the above should at least make you question the adage of "millennials can't afford homes because they spend it all on avocados and coffee"<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>,<a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>.</p>

        <h3>Compare Different Years</h3>
        <p>The tool below will allow you to select two years from 1955 to 2017 and compare how long it took/takes to pay off the average house price for the years selected, based on the contribution you are willing to make from the average, monthly disposable income for that year.</p>

        <p>When discussing problems that affect generations differently, I thought it may be helpful to first of all define those generations. While there are many definitions of the various generations out there (normally deviating slightly in terms of what year constitutes the start/end of a generation), I have chosen to include the definition of the not-for-profit "fact" tank <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/11/millennials-largest-generation-us-labor-force/ft_18-04-02_generationsdefined2017_working-age/">Pew Research Center</a> here.</p>

        <h3>Caveats</h3>
        <p>There will almost certainly be a few exceptions to what is displayed above.</p>
        <p>The data used in this web app provides <em>average</em> house prices and <em>average</em> real disposable income by year from 1955 to 2017. The mean (average) is sensitive to extreme values/outliers and thus may not give a 100% accurate reflection of the underlying distribution. However, based on the assumption that the sample size that led to the figures reported was significantly large and that there was no significant bias in the sample distribution, I would like to think that the mean is the measure that fits best.</p>
        <p>So somebody saying "I paid less/more for my house" does not invalidate the overall point of a widening gap between house prices and income.</p>
